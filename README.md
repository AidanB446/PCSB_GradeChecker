# BasicGradeChecker

Easy interface for pcsb students to check their grades when they dont want to open webbrowser.
You may steal the getGrades function if you want to make a terminal application to  check grades. 

The GUI takes a bit too load because python tkinter isn't the fastest. So sorry. I have the same project written
in java, and the GUI loads alot faster

The main.exe is the compiled python file that is ready for distribution/download if you just want to test it.
If you download the .exe file, then you wont need to install the contents of requirements.txt


python installation :
pip install -r requirements.txt
