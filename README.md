# BasicGradeChecker

Easy interface for pcsb students to check their grades when they dont want to open webbrowser.
You may steal the getGrades function if you want to make a terminal application to  check grades. 

The GUI takes a bit too load because python tkinter isn't the fastest. So sorry. I have the same project written
in java. 


installation :
pip install -r requirements.txt
